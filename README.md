Copyright and Usage Notice

This code is an extended and improved implementation based on the CNN-backbone Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) code developed and provided by Oh and Ham (2024), as originally proposed in the following study:
Oh, S. H., & Ham, Y. G. (2024). Few shot learning for Korean winter temperature forecasts. npj Climate and Atmospheric Science, 7(1), 279.
(Official GitHub repository to be referenced upon public release)

The present work integrates the ExtremeCast methodology to enhance extreme value prediction performance through the implementation of the Exloss loss function and the ExBooster approach, as described in:
ExtremeCast: Boosting Extreme Value Prediction for Global Weather Forecast- Xu, W., Chen, K., Han, T., Chen, H., Ouyang, W., & Bai, L. (2024). Extremecast: Boosting extreme value prediction for global weather forecast. arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.01295.
Their codes and the model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/black-yt/ExtremeCast

This improved model code was developed at Seoul National University, South Korea, by: Seohee Yang (seoheey0428@snu.ac.kr) & Seok-Woo Son (seokwooson@snu.ac.kr)
and was funded by the Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program under Grant (RS-2025-02307979)
